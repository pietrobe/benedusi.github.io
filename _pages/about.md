As a computational mathematician, my focus has been numerical analysis and PDEs modelling through large-scale simulations, particularly in solar physics research, computational neuroscience, and electrophysiology. Currently, computational physics is my main field of interest, developing numerical schemes for large radiative transfer simulations to understand Sun magnetism better. With this regard, I work in close collaboration with the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC) and the Institute of Solar Research (IRSOL).

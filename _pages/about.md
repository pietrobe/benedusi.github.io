As a computational mathematician my focus is in numerical analysis and PDEs modelling through large-scale simulations, particularly in solar physics research, computational neuroscience, and electrophysiology. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the **Simula Research Laboratory** in Oslo.


### Education

+ **Ph.D.**, Computational Science, Università della Svizzera Italiana, 2020
+ **M.A.**, Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, Università della Svizzera Italiana, 2015
